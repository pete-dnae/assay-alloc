# Binpacking displacement

Did not yield a solution logically.

It would be very efficient if we were assuming the presence of only one target.
But in the presence of an unknown number of targets, now amount of disambiguation
allocation can provide a solution.

# Set theoretic

Did not yield a solution logically.


# Random alloc probabilistic

Looks like it provides a logically coherent solution.
But the probabalistic nature becomes less trustworthy as the number of targets 
present increases.
