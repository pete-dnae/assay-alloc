Overview
--------

The web app is delivered to the browser, as one single homogeneous html web
page.  There is no client side javascript app.  Although the "smart" Bootstrap
CSS library is used by this page. The user's perception that there is a
separate "home" page and "settings" page is created by both being present in
the html delivered, but always with one or the other set to be invisible.

This design obviates the need for either client or server to hold the user's
interaction state (for example which assays they have checked on the home
page). Instead, all the user's input state is carried in html form fields and
thus are automically preservered across requests.

The "save" and "load" buttons will bring up Bootstrap modal dialogues that
will require the user to specify the name to save-as or load from.
