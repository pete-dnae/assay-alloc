o  First upgrade existing implementation to have a method that in one optimized
   go, assesses - all chambers will fire but spuriously
    *  What is this logic psuedo code?
    *  Mention bin packing / dynamic programming in notes.
    *  Code as such
    o  Upgrade all tests to suit
        *  List tests required
        o  Add tests from utils upwards
            *  _filter_reserved_chamber_sets(chamber_set_for_P)
            *  _target_set_need_not_be_tested(

            o  end to end
                o  Bring back in those relevant of old tests
                o  What learned?
                o  what else at system level?

o  Test that proves mutex and cover of allocation?
o  Make report for Brad even if can't ship yet.

o  Full result correctness test
o  Calling test / or report
o  What realist targets present set sizes?

o  Regression tests and clean out of redundant code.
o  If works, decide how to update API and get to Brad

o  Merit in seeking more headroom

o  Ditch concept of Assays with replicas?
o  Real hard-coded assay names
o  Calling in clinical terms
o  Impact of failing chamber
o  Password protect

o  Make root url take you form
o  Is all the docker legacy pointless?

o  Combined will all fire and spuriously

chamber_sets = the reserved chamber sets the alloc has reserved, and to which
            we just challenged the vulnerability of by adding P to somewhere.
            (Dynamic programming)

for each chamber set in chamber_sets:
    Known facts
        o  which assay reserved it F
        o  F is in all chambers
        o  it has P in somewhere
        o  it wasn't vulnerable until we put P in somewhere
    for all possible target sets:
        # Quick non-chamber-wise wins early...

        # If the target set has the reserving assay (F) in it, all the 
        # chambers in the chamber set will fire. - Legitimately, not 
        # spuriously.
        if target set has F in it:
            continue 
        # if this target set doesn't have P in it, it cannot
        # introduce any NEW reasons for all the chambers to fire that weren't
        # covered by the assessment when the assay type that preceded P was
        # being allocated. (Dynamic programming)
        if target set does not have P in it:
            continue

        # Now the more costly chamber-wise tests
        for each chamber 1,4,7:
            get occupants
            no fire = if none in common with {A,D,F,S}
                early return
        if reach here all chambers did fire despite absence of assay
        that reserved the chamber set - boo hoo
        return sad
