o  Add in replicas must be > to narrative and make it shorter.
o  Need we use all the target sets in assessing vulnerability, or can we
   decimate these with some reasoning?
o  Why is it getting stuck on assay_I?
    o  Replicas must be > target set size
    o  Can we get 20 assays into 24 chambers with 5-targets to work? A-T
o  Test that proves mutex and cover of allocation?
o  Make report for Brad even if can't ship yet.

o  Create unit test for optimisation in 
   _is_allocation_with_assay_P_added_vulnerable( that skips reserved chamber
   sets if we didn't put assay_P into it. (And vice versa). Nb. is known to
   be firing by manual scrutiny.

o  Full result correctness test
o  Calling test / or report
o  What realist targets present set sizes?

o  Regression tests and clean out of redundant code.
o  If works, decide how to update API and get to Brad

o  Merit in seeking more headroom

o  Ditch concept of Assays with replicas?
o  Real hard-coded assay names
o  Calling in clinical terms
o  Impact of failing chamber
o  Password protect

o  Make root url take you form
o  Is all the docker legacy pointless?
