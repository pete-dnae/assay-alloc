Current flaw
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    o  20 assays into 40 chambers, with 3 replicas and 3 targets
    o  Our targets are ABC
    o  O and P are false positives.
    o  Because (take O)
        o  O's colocations are: OA OB OC
        o  Every O is colocated with either an A or a B or a C.
    o  How could say the third O have been located to have avoided the
       false positive?
        o  It could have gone later in the grid to be colocated with say D,
           with D not being a target.
        o  But we are blind to which assays are targets during allocation. Had
           the targets been AB-D the same problem would have arisen.

    o  Can we say this in narrative?
        o  This particular false positive
            o  Even when a non-target assay has non overlapping co-located
               mixes, it can still produce a false positive if each of its
               mixes coincidentally includes one of the targets.
        o  What creates false positives in general?
            o  When every instance of a non-target assay happens to be in a
               group that contains one of the targets.

    o  Potential remedy
        o  What if we hypothesise that their is a hidden set of (say) 3
           targets.
        o  We can therefore assess whether an allocation of O somewhere would
           by chance mean that every location of O happens also to contain one
           of the 3 targets, thus creating a false positive. This would be one 
           negative reason (a score of one) against locating P there.
        o  If we were to repeat this with every
