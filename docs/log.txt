*  PossibleTargets - no point in including subsets of the greatest set size
o  Why is it getting stuck on assay_I?
    o  Replicas must be > target set size
    o  Can we get 20 assays into 24 chambers with 5-targets to work? A-T
o  Need we use all the target sets in assessing vulnerability, or can we
   decimate these with some reasoning.
o  Make report for Brad even if can't ship yet.

o  Create unit test for optimisation in 
   _is_allocation_with_assay_P_added_vulnerable( that skips reserved chamber
   sets if we didn't put assay_P into it. (And vice versa). Nb. is known to
   be firing by manual scrutiny.

o  Full result correctness test
o  Calling test / or report
o  What realist targets present set sizes?

o  Regression tests and clean out of redundant code.
o  If works, decide how to update API and get to Brad

o  Merit in seeking more headroom

o  Ditch concept of Assays with replicas?
o  Real hard-coded assay names
o  Calling in clinical terms
o  Impact of failing chamber
o  Password protect

o  Make root url take you form
o  Is all the docker legacy pointless?

Stuck on assay I
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assays prior to I are getting allocated to contiguous blocks like this:

XXX reserving frozenset([1, 2, 3]) for A
XXX reserving frozenset([4, 5, 6]) for B
XXX reserving frozenset([8, 9, 7]) for C
XXX reserving frozenset([10, 11, 12]) for D
XXX reserving frozenset([13, 14, 15]) for E
XXX reserving frozenset([16, 17, 18]) for F
XXX reserving frozenset([19, 20, 21]) for G
XXX reserving frozenset([24, 22, 23]) for H

So I is the first assay encountered once all chambers have something in.

We are looking for a new candidate for a reserved chamber set.

We might consider {4,9,11}

These are occupied thus:
4 has B
9 has C
11 has D

Which would be vulnerable to a false positive in the presence of {BCD}.

This regime cannot work, because any choice of 3 chambers is bound to be
uni-fired by the right 3-member target set.

Does this mean we have to make sure our replica sets are substantially bigger
than the target sets we hypothesise?

Consider this case altered by continuing with target sets up to 5, but
asking for 6 replicas. Do we get further than I?

First try 8 replicas - much bigger than our target sets of 5
    Covers all chambers by the time it gets to E, i.e. earlier than before.
