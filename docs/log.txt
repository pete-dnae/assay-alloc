o  Problem, with this config:
    o  python assay-alloc.py --assays 20 --replicas 3 --chambers 30 --dontmix 3 --targets 2
        o  The first 3 chambers all contain just a A and K replica - wasted discrim
            *  Replace Assay.chambers_in_fewest_occupants_order() with a heuristic
               inside the allocator.
            o  Fix up Assay unit tests if fewest_occupants_order() gone.
            o  Quick play with cmd line above
                o  Investigate B1 going to chamber 1 on top of A1 and not
                   faviouring 4 which would be mt at that time.
                    *  How debug with these params
                    *  Break out set size differencing engine
                    o  do filter pipe but start with makes fewest pair duplicates
                        *  alloc qry pairs present and test
                        *  use iter tools where needed
                        *  pipeline with 3 bengign filters (positive)
                        o  make sure chamber number alone works
                            o  create ref experiment with no dontmix
                            o  make way to inject filters from test
                            o  use filter to invoke only chamber number
                            o  why doesnt C1 go into 5
                        o  make sure existing count alone works
                        o  make sure chamber number with existing count combined works
                        o  mix in dupe pairs
            o  How to unit test?
            o  Are setcomparisons redundant

o  Haven't explored limits and swapping
o  Move experiment inputs into model
o  Get to read from exp design file or Qt?
o  Sort deployment
    o  Incl dependency on pyyaml
o  Write usage intructions
