o  alter cmd line app report to make report that would be fit for purpose 
   to show brad but on simple example.
    *  scope design
    *  report implementation design using jinja2 perhaps
    *  does experiment design need to change?
    o  re-base the command line app
        *  reading cmd line args
            *  design new cmd line args
        *  launching experiment
        o  reporting experiment
            *  scan existing reporter - contents no use
            o  design what should work as interface
            o  work up piecemeal data and template
o  can we make it work with headroom of 2 with small case?
o  put in progress output for bigger data sets
o  put in premature stop if input params doomed
o  report cope with failure
o  can we make it work with headroom of 2 with realistic case?
o  how long does realistic test take on its own?

o  profile it later


o  Test that proves mutex and cover of allocation?
o  Make report for Brad even if can't ship yet.

o  Experiment reporter now redundant i think
o  Full result correctness test
o  Calling test / or report
o  What realist targets present set sizes?

o  Regression tests and clean out of redundant code.
o  If works, decide how to update API and get to Brad

o  Merit in seeking more headroom

o  Ditch concept of Assays with replicas?
o  Real hard-coded assay names
o  Calling in clinical terms
o  Impact of failing chamber
o  Password protect

o  Make root url take you form
o  Is all the docker legacy pointless?

Experiment was:
    o  Input settings
        o  Number of assays
        o  Number of chambers
        o  Choose first/last <N> assays as the don't mix pairs.
        o  Guarantee no false positives for up to <N> targets present
           simultaneously.
    o  Extrapolated Settings
        o  Letters chosen to represent assays
        o  Which non mix assays got chosen
        o  Replicas needed to guarantee no FP = 7
    o  Allocation Results - Reserved Chambers
        o  List of chambers and what allocator put in them
        o  Calling chamber set for each assay
