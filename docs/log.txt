o  set max size by defn to one less than replicas
    o  see if fixes this problem
        o  are we locked onto everything having same n replicas?
        o  if so enforce and include in narrative


o  Test that proves mutex and cover of allocation?
o  Make report for Brad even if can't ship yet.

o  Full result correctness test
o  Calling test / or report
o  What realist targets present set sizes?

o  Regression tests and clean out of redundant code.
o  If works, decide how to update API and get to Brad

o  Merit in seeking more headroom

o  Ditch concept of Assays with replicas?
o  Real hard-coded assay names
o  Calling in clinical terms
o  Impact of failing chamber
o  Password protect

o  Make root url take you form
o  Is all the docker legacy pointless?

reserve 123 for A
reserve 456 for B

adding C to 367 makes the allocation vulnerable because in the presence
of AB, all of 367 fire despite C not being present

test should ensure that a target set that contains AB is the one that points
this out
