*  Get decent ascii report coming out
    *  Work out how to pretty print a data structure
    *  Design what want to see
    *  Make it so

*  Improve randomness
o  Problem, with this config:
    o  python assay-alloc.py --assays 20 --replicas 3 --chambers 30 --dontmix 3 --targets 2
        o  The first 3 chambers all contain just a A and K replica - wasted discrim
            *  Replace Assay.chambers_in_fewest_occupants_order() with a heuristic
               inside the allocator.
            o  Fix up Assay unit tests if fewest_occupants_order() gone.
            o  Quick play with cmd line above
                o  Investigate B1 going to chamber 1 on top of A1 and not
                   faviouring 4 which would be mt at that time.
                    *  How debug with these params
                    *  Break out set size differencing engine
                    o  do filter pipe but start with makes fewest pair duplicates
                        o  alloc qry pairs present and test
                        o  pipeline with 3 bengign filters
                        o  make fewest pairs created and observe
                        o  add in occupancy
                        o  add in chamber number
            o  How to unit test?

o  Haven't explored limits and swapping
o  Move experiment inputs into model
o  Get to read from exp design file or Qt?
o  Sort deployment
    o  Incl dependency on pyyaml
o  Write usage intructions
