o  AppEngine develop
    *  Basics
    *  Augment input table with actual assays, targets and dontmix pairs
    *  Make the view model from the form params not hard coded
    *  Ditch header rows on table
    *  Show which assays are the target
    *  Show which chambers fired
    o  Show calling stats
        *  Think again how
        *  Hard code first to get look and feel and show data needs
        o  Make data available
            o  Time out to clean up and unit test reporter incl comments vs
               alloc
               o  Currently got to test_format_assays_in_chambers_that_fired
                  looking suspicious
            o  Print out view model at point of build
        o  Use data
            o  Assay letter and message
            o  Tidy up presso
            o  Blue for fired rows
        o  Is firing reporting actually right? - double check unit tests
        o  Make it show nothing until form submitted
    o  Page layout and headings
    o  Say apply not allocate
    o  Make targets in input settings be blue
    o  Prune down reporter and clear up scope in comments cf alloc
    o  Add unit test for
        o  coverage of reporter methods
o  Fix algorithm

o  Let you specify which targets not how many
o  Wean off dependency on yaml so that nosetests across models all work
o  How protect ExperimentDesign.make_from_form_dict() from mal formed form?
o  Algorithm doc page (incl cookie persist form on other)
o  Diagnostics page (incl cookie persist form on other)
o  Release notes page
o  And the rest is history
o  Is all the docker legacy pointless?
