*  Come up with definition of starter problem
*  Decide what stack
*  Decide what deployment
*  Think ahead to visualisation
*  Persisted data model
*  Make sure visualisation can be form and url driven
    *  form values
    *  urls
*  Design template model
    *  Complete content
    *  Template hierarchy or inclusion composition (defer)
*  OOD and functional design of python
    *  algorithm
    *  settings oriented
    *  end points and helpers
    *  view centric
o  Dev plan
    *  Bring up flask, hello world in docker scratch mode
        *  Decide if use flask dev server, or cherrypy or gunicorn.
        *  Find reputable looking tutorial and do throwaway try.
            *  https://hub.docker.com/r/tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask/
        *  Follow tutorial and make notes in studies
    *  Migrate to a code in repo
        *  Consider if the demo docker folder system is ok for the project, or
           needs wrapper levels
            *  Can use example project with package structure
        *  Create repo in pete-dnae with readme
        *  Clone to linux space
    *  Put docs alongside
    *  Leave readme behind in old place
    *  Put static where recommended
    *  Mix in this docco folder to the repo
    *  Get running from flask runner
        *  Create venv
        *  TDD up suitable venv and requirements.txt or is it yaml?
            *  try cmd line flask run and see what happens
    *  Mix in token templating to app
    *  Get auto code reload and debug going from dev script
    *  Mix in bootstrap UI viewwise and static serving wise
        *  make sure resources are in app/static so that prodn nginx will
           serve them
           *  test with static_thing.html
        *  but configure flask to auto serve them too during dev
        *  use trivial bootstrap example from tutorial
    *  Re try docker mount experiment post reboot
    *  How about running docker from windows client?
    *  Try recipe here: = successful

    o  Back to volume style development
        o  Ditch venv
        o  Remove local run dev script
        o  Make sure committed and pushed
        o  clone into c:/shared - maybe shortened name
        o  resume tutorial and note it to get volumes and restart working

    o  Fall back on bringing up container and deriving pip requirements from it
       to make local env identical.
    o  Mix in flask-shelve
    o  Validate db is going to work when need it
    o  Start top down serving view - just basics
    o  Move rapidly to rough coding of starter models
    o  Refine them and get them to work using TDD
    o  Then bring up rest of non persisted view
    o  Add persisted named assay sets
    o  Download popper rather than using cdn

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stack
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements

o  Has to be web app from the get go to make it easy for people to engage with
o  Has to be simple and familiar - cannot spend time on this
o  Need persistence
o  Nice if could very simple deploy using docker or app engine
o  Will need to move to enterprise IT eventually

Implications

o  Has to be Python
o  Can be trad server side html templating
o  Rule out server based DB
o  Rule out GAE
o  Can use Flask-Shelve for persistence.

Conclusions

o  Flask should be baseline
o  Find trivial file based key value store (value is entire db in yaml, or
   json)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deployment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Docker image comprising Flask, Shelve, and Bootstrap with GUnicorn or CherryPy
as WSGI server.
Using mounted volume to allow dev iteration.
Deployed eventually on DNAe server, but in mean time, GCE or EC2 instance, and
even sooner locally.
