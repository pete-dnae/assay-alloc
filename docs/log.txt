*  Get decent ascii report coming out
    *  Work out how to pretty print a data structure
    *  Design what want to see
    *  Make it so
*  Report in order of % pop deployed
*  Cmd line usage
*  Quick freeze experiment
*  Doc freeze deploy
o  Improve randomness
    *  Test new allocation algorithm up to getting stuck point.
    o  Bring back up cmd line routine
        o  Upgrade cmd line parsing to new requirements
            *  Design how
            *     Make it so
            *  See if can get cmd line app running to completion
            *  Debug output with reference experiment
                *  Make report explicit strings not auto dump
                *  Output from example below looks wrong
                    *  Aloocation not affected by dont mix
            o  Revert to cmd line with:
                o  python assay-alloc.py --assays 15 --replicas 4 --chambers 20 --dontmix 3 --targets 1
                o  does it give decent results with more realistic numbers?
                o  Problem, with this config:
                    o  python assay-alloc.py --assays 20 --replicas 3 --chambers 30 --dontmix 3 --targets 2
                    o  The first 3 chambers all contain just a A and K replica - wasted discrim
        o  Strip down and make reporting apt

o  Haven't explored limits and swapping
o  Move experiment inputs into model
o  Get to read from exp design file or Qt?
o  Sort deployment
    o  Incl dependency on pyyaml
o  Write usage intructions
