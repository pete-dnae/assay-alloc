Notes to publish
    o  Interset limit is 2 always (old code discredited)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Switch to solely Windows and Python27 env to make exe
*  Push
*  Refactor into better dir structure using pycharm help
    *  hierarchy
    *  names and comments
*  Add check that no sets intersect by more than foo
*  Refactor as fast sets of ChamberSet
o  Make and emit new doe.csv
o  Work up doe graph output
o  Make decent coverage overnight
o  See if Qt and my builder viable in this env and can be packaged
o  Assuming so
o  Work out how to present real assay choices UXP / storage
o  Make sure existing single point run can work with this input
o  Make sure reporting can cope with long assay names
o  Add matrix style alloc to reporting
o  Develop and package gui app to run and store set of tests as reports
   incl sharing and storing of evolving assays as xls, or yaml or db

Inevitable?

max targets is 2,
hence reps is 5
creating allocs of size 5
8 chambers avail
max inter is n-1, which is 1

so alloc a to 1 2 3 4 5

cf 2 5 6 7 8 in offing for B

overlap is 2 5 - greater than 1, so must be removed

can you choose a 5-set from  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 that overlaps with
1 2 3 4 5 by only one?

has be {12345678} - {12345}, plus one of {2,5}
ie {678} + either 2 or 5

NO!!!! because can only assemble 4 members, not the required 5

What is the generalisation here?

nchambers - nreps + 1 = nreps

or

nchambers = 2 * nreps - 1

subst ntargets

nchambers = 2 * (ntargets + 3) -1

min_nchambers = 2 * ntargets + 5

for ntargets = 2, min chambers is 9
