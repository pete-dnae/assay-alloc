o  Timeout to deal with distorted spread
    o  Using {1,2} then one different for third for each incoming assay.
       Loading 1 and 2 excessively.
       o  When iterating through the potential chamber sets, do so in
          smallest stack created.
         *  Find place to code it - inside draw_possible_chamber..
         o  Add a test for that
            o  In middle of it
         o  Does it spread main allocator test?

o  Should we only bother with chamber sets to which we just added P?
    o  Yes
        *  Measure if we're cutting some out = we are not
        o  Why not?
            o  Note which chamber sets we are reserving
            o  Note which chamber sets we are hypothetically adding P to
            o  Can we see a pattern whereby the previous reserverations would
               have  no overlap with where we are adding P to?
o  Is there a shortcut to firing and not spurious or inverse?
o  Not seen retraction

o  Full result correctness test
o  Calling test / or report
o  What realist targets present set sizes?

o  Regression tests and clean out of redundant code.
o  If works, decide how to update API and get to Brad

o  Merit in seeking more headroom

o  Ditch concept of Assays with replicas?
o  Real hard-coded assay names
o  Calling in clinical terms
o  Impact of failing chamber
o  Password protect

o  Make root url take you form
o  Is all the docker legacy pointless?

o  When  assessing vulnerability, can we only bother with chamber sets to 
   which we just added P?
