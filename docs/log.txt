The allocation in the round is vulnerable if any of the chamber sets
ring fenced to call some assay when they all fire, have any cause to fire
other than the presence of the target they are trying to call.

So having just done a trial addition of P into chamber set 147 we can look
at all the reserved assay sets, and ask if they have any reason to fire other
than their reserving assay being present.
