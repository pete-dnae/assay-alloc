o  Get decent ascii report coming out
    *  Work out how to pretty print a data structure
    *  Design what want to see
    o  Make it so
o  Get to read from exp design file
o  Sort deployment
    o  Incl dependency on pyyaml
o  Write usage intructions

Kernel Scope
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Define experiments as
    num chambers avail
    list of assay names
    how many replicas of each assay wanted
    list of mutex assay pairs

Define exp simulation as which assay targets present k
Create and Allocate Assay subsets to chambers in loops until placed
sufficient.

Create from feed of random alloc sets (seeded).
Skip any which contravene pair rules.

Create results capability (object)
    assays in each chamber looku up both ways
    count of each assay type in firing chambers
        (should incriminate which assays)
    summary result = believe these assays present cos of these characteristics
    vs reference char

Dev Milestones
- Defn of model and test helper to make fixed one
- Loop to generate and skip subsets
- Allocate them to chambers until sufficient
- Interpreter
- Create results model
- Report results to screen
- Entry point that uses cmd line args to build models from file
- Comments
- Tests
- Consider deployment
