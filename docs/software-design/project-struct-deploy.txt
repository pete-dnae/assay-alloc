Intended to deployed as Flask App, with uwsgi in front, and nginx in front of
that.

All dockerised into a single container following this example and guidance:

https://hub.docker.com/r/tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask/

Static Files
------------

Live in /app/static/
The container cited above gets nginx to serve the files in this location
automoatically. However, we also code Flask to treat them as static so it still
works when running the app in dev mode using the "flask" dev server. Requests
to /static/anything should never reach the flask app in production.
