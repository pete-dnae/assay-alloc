o  Bugs
    o  Some classes need equals() implementation to work in sets.
    o  Get better db storage solution
        o  Using local db is naff for concurrent users
        o  Switch to S3 buckets later
        o  And can the remove dependency on flask-shelve
o  Allocation Quality
    o  We are neglecting the possibility that generated location demands
       might already be met by coincidence by a current Allocation. If we go
       on to exploit these, we must avoid using them more than once as sisters
       for the same trigger assay.
o  Research better use of cookies
o  Show calling login in output
