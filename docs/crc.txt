                            chamber.

                                Holds ColocatedAssayPair(s).

                            an ExperimentMandate. Encapsulates an algorithmic
                            approach and relevant heuristics.

                                has-a DoMix

GeneratedLocationDemands    A set of LocationDemands that have been generated
                            or inferred to be necessary as a side effect of
                            having just colocated A<n> with other assays in a
                            chamber.

LocationDemand              Encapsulates the instruction (or need) to place a
                            given assay A<n>, "somewhere", including  the
                            conditions that must be met by "somewhere" for it
                            to be legal. E.g. a list of assays that must not
                            be already incumbent.

LocationDemandGenerator     A factory for GeneratedLocationDemands, that
                            encapsulates the inference decisions.

NoSolutionError             An exception that carries the message that no
                            solution is available.

PlacementInProgress         Holds the allocation to chamber allocation
                            decisions made so far whilst a solution is being
                            searched for.

                                place_here(A<n>, C<i>)
                                make_copy()
                                convenient_queries()

PlacementSolution           A thing that holds a PlacementInProgress, which is
                            known to be a satisfactory solution. Has extra
                            capabilities that are only relevant to a
                            successful solution, like specialised queries /
                            export functions.

SetOfAssays                 Models a set of assays

                                data is just a set of name strings

Solver                      Can take high level responsibility for creating a
                            PlacementSolution, by "choosing" a
                            BinPackingAlgorithm, introducing it to an
                            ExperimentMandate, and firing the solve() method.


Settings
--------

AssayCatalog                Owns the complete list of assay names that all
                            users have edited into the system over time.

AssayCollection             A user-specified subset of names from the
                            AssayCatalog, to which a user has given a name
                            to refer to it by.

AssayCollections            A library of AssayCollection(s)

                                Holds AssayCollection(s) in such a way to
                                provide convenience functions. E.g.

                                get('collection_fred')

                                all_collections_that_reference(assay_1)

Settings                    The top-level container for all settings.

                                has-an AssayCatalog
                                has-an AssayCollections

WebApp
------

It will help to understand the context of the classes on this section, to read
the "web app structure" sister document.

ViewModel                   The data model that holds all the values,
                            required to parameterise the html rendering.
                            Used in calls to Flasks html template renderer.
                            See "template-model.txt".

ViewModelBuilder            A thing that knows how to build a ViewModel, from 
                            incoming form values and a provided PlacementSolution.
                            Excluding which parts should be made invisible.

ViewRenderer                A thing that generates the html to render the app,
                            using a provided ViewModel.

                                Uses Flask's html templating library.

SettingsSerializer          A duck-typed thing that offers the service of 
                            persisting a Settings object in whatever (black
                            box) storage solution it uses behind the scenes),
                            and the service of building a Settings from its
                            behind the scenes storage on demand.

                                Initial implementation likely to be 
                                Flask-Shelve, or TinyDB.
