Before running or deploying this application, install the dependencies using
[pip](http://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/):

    pip install -t lib -r requirements.txt

**NOTE THE -T LIB ARGUMENTS - THESE ARE VITAL**
This causes the packages to be installed into the lib folder and when you run
the app engine deploy command it will send this library too.
